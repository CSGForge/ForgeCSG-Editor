CSGForge-Editor is a 3D modeling tool that uses [CSGForge-Core](https://github.com/CSGForge/CSGForge-Core) to create models using [Constructive Solid Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry) and export them to standard 3D model formats such as `.FBX` and `.OBJ`.

## Building The Editor

This repository uses [Premake](https://premake.github.io/) to generate a build system. The following instructions assume you're also using Premake. To clone the repository (including submodules) run:
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CSGForge/CSGForge-Core.git
```

The only tested generated build system is Makefiles. Other systems generated by Premake should also work though. To generate and build using Makefiles run:
```sh
premake5 gmake2
make -C build
```
